Tender is the night lying by your side
    <br>
    Tender is the touch of someone that you love too much
    <br>
    Tender is the day the demons go away
    <br>
    Lord, I need to find someone who can heal my mind
    <br>
    Come on, come on, come on
    Get through it
    <br>
    Come on, come on, come on
    Love's the greatest thing
    <br>
    Come on, come on, come on
    Get through it
    <br>
    Come on, come on, come on
    Love's the greatest thing that we have
    <br>
    I'm waiting for that feeling
    <br>
    Waiting for that feeling
    <br>
    Waiting for that feeling to come
    <br>
    Oh my baby, oh my baby
    <br>
    Oh why, oh my?<br>

    Oh my baby, oh my baby
    Oh why, oh my?
    
    Tender is the ghost, the ghost I love the most
    Hiding from the sun, waiting for the night to come
    Tender is my heart, I'm screwing up my life
    Lord, I need to find someone who can heal my mind
    Come on, come on, come on
    Get through it
    Come on, come on, come on
    Love's the greatest thing
    Come on, come on, come on
    Get through it
    Come on, come on, come on
    Love's the greatest thing that we have
    I'm waiting for that feeling
    Waiting for that feeling
    Waiting for that feeling to come
    Oh my baby, oh my baby
    Oh why, oh my?
    Oh my baby, oh my baby
    Oh why, oh my?
    Come on, come on, come on
    Get through it
    Come on, come on, come on
    Love's the greatest thing
    Come on, come on, come on
    Get through it
    Come on, come on, come on
    Love's the greatest thing that we have
    I'm waiting for that feeling
    Waiting for that feeling
    Waiting for that feeling to come
    Oh my baby, oh my baby
    Oh why, oh my?
    Oh my baby, oh my baby
    Oh why, oh my?
